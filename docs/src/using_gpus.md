# Using GPUs

A big feature of Oceananigans is being able to run on graphical processing units (GPUs).

You need
1. A CUDA compatible Nvidia GPU.
2. CUDA library
3.

You'll want a GPU with good 64-bit floating point performance although Oceananigans can be used with 32-bit floating point numbers.

## Getting access to GPUs
1. Local cluster
2. Cloud computing providers
3. Buy a GPU (might not be worth it)
4. CodeOcean
