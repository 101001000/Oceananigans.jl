# Convection into a linearly stratified fluid

We are performing 'large eddy simulations' (actually, direct numerical 
simulations with artificially elevated viscosity and diffusivity)
of convection into a stratified fluid. 
Our parameters regime corresponds roughly to conditions that
occur in the North Atlantic ocean in winter.

## Parameters:

ν : 
κ :
