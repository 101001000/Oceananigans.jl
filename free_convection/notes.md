# Convection into a linearly stratified fluid

We are performing 'large eddy simulations' (actually, direct numerical 
simulations with artificially elevated viscosity and diffusivity)
of convection into a stratified fluid. 
Our parameters regime corresponds roughly to conditions that
occur in the North Atlantic ocean in winter.

## Parameters:

ν : 10^(-2)       (m^2 / s)  
κ : 10^(-2)       (m^2 / s)
N2: 6.4x10^(-7)   (1/s^2)
f : 10^(-4)       (1/s)
FB: 2x10^(-7)
